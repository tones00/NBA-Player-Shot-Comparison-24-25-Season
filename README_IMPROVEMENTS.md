# Basketball Shot Tracker - Improvements Made

## ‚úÖ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Axis Ranges**
- **Before**: Fixed axis ranges that might not show all data properly
- **After**: All axes start at 0 and automatically adjust to fit all data points
- **Benefit**: Every data point is visible and properly scaled

### 2. **Scatter Plot Format**
- **X-axis**: Field Goal Attempts (FGA) - shows shooting volume
- **Y-axis**: Field Goal Percentage (FG%) - shows shooting efficiency
- **Benefit**: Easy to see who shoots more vs. who shoots better

### 3. **Multiple Chart Types**
- **3-Point Shooting Chart**: Shows 3PT attempts vs. 3PT percentage
- **2-Point Shooting Chart**: Shows 2PT attempts vs. 2PT percentage  
- **Free Throw Chart**: Shows FT attempts vs. FT percentage
- **Overall Efficiency Chart**: Bar chart comparing total shooting stats

### 4. **Multi-Player Support**
- Compare 2-8 players simultaneously
- Different colors and markers for each player
- All data points visible on properly scaled axes

### 5. **Smart Data Fitting**
- 10% padding added to ranges for better visualization
- Y-axis minimum starts at 0 or 90% of lowest value (whichever is higher)
- X-axis always starts at 0
- Automatic scaling ensures all data is visible

## üìä Chart Interpretation Guide

### Scatter Plot Reading:
- **Top Right**: High volume + High efficiency (Best players)
- **Top Left**: Low volume + High efficiency (Efficient but limited shooters)
- **Bottom Right**: High volume + Low efficiency (Volume shooters)
- **Bottom Left**: Low volume + Low efficiency (Limited role players)

### Color Coding:
- **Blue**: Player 1 (in 2-player comparison)
- **Red**: Player 2 (in 2-player comparison)
- **Multiple Colors**: Different players (in multi-player comparison)
- **Dashed Gray Line**: League average reference

### Zone Abbreviations:
- **RA**: Restricted Area
- **Paint**: In The Paint (Non-RA)
- **Mid**: Mid-Range
- **LC3**: Left Corner 3
- **RC3**: Right Corner 3
- **ATB3**: Above the Break 3
- **FT**: Free Throws

## üöÄ How to Run

### Two-Player Comparison:
```bash
python scatter_charts.py
```

### Multi-Player Comparison (2-8 players):
```bash
python multi_player_charts.py
```

### Original Court Visualization:
```bash
python demo.py
```

## üìà Sample Data Features

The system includes realistic sample data for popular players:
- **Stephen Curry**: Elite 3PT shooter with high FT%
- **LeBron James**: High-volume 2PT scorer with lower 3PT%
- **Kevin Durant**: Balanced scorer with excellent mid-range
- **Joel Embiid**: Dominant inside scorer with good FT%
- **Giannis Antetokounmpo**: Paint-dominant with lower 3PT%

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **All Data Visible**: No data points cut off by axis limits
2. **Proper Scaling**: Axes automatically adjust to data range
3. **Clear Comparisons**: Easy to see volume vs. efficiency trade-offs
4. **Multiple Perspectives**: Different shot types analyzed separately
5. **Professional Visualization**: Clean, publication-ready charts

## üìÅ Files Created

- `scatter_charts.py` - Two-player comparison with dynamic ranges
- `multi_player_charts.py` - Multi-player comparison (2-8 players)
- `demo.py` - Original court visualization demo
- `webScraper.py` - Full web scraping functionality
- `requirements.txt` - All required dependencies
- `setup.py` - Easy installation script

The improved system now provides comprehensive basketball shooting analysis with properly scaled, data-driven visualizations that make it easy to compare players across different shooting categories and volumes.
